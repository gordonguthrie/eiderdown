<h1>Showdown Compatibility Unit Test Generator For <code>erlmarkdown</code></h1>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>erlmarkdown is a server-side implementation of markdown written in Erlang. In order to practically use it, you need a client side implementation (written in javascript) which <em>produces the same outputs from the same inputs</em>.</p>
<p>The client-side library of choice for <code>erlmarkdown</code> is <code>showdown</code> from <a href="http://attacklab.com">Attack Labs</a>.</p>
<p>It is not clear if showdown is still maintained - it is not available
from a version control system. The current version we track is 0.9 and the
source code is included with erlmarkdown.</p>
<p>This page just has a set of markdown terms in it which it runs through showdown to generate the unit tests that are included in <code>erlmarkdown</code></p>
