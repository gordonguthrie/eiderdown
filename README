# Eiderdown

## What is it?

Eiderdown is a very small markdown - cut down from my library `erlmarkdown`

## Why?

Markdown is a full cycle markup language - you publish:
* the markdown text as text on webpages
* the rendered html on webpages, in mail readers, in bully-boards

Eiderdown is a reduced cycle markup language, for parts of the production cycle of ebooks, for:
* writing the text
* copy editing/reviewing/commenting
* line editing

The heavy lifting of designing that text is handed off to CSS for:
* pubishlishing fragments as chaff
  * html
  * pdf
* publishing the content as a full commercial ebook
